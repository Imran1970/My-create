            <p>I usually get into the office somewhere between eight-thirty and nine, before the hubbub starts. This is the best time to get some peace and quiet, and gives me the chance to get organized for the day ahead. I spend about 45 minutes sifting through my emails and Slack messages. I’m a zero-inbox person, so the only emails in my inbox are open tasks that I need to work on or respond to - everything else is archived. I’ll then check for errors and bug reports to see if any issues cropped up while I was gone, and prioritize my to-do list accordingly.</p>

            <p>lthough these ideas may look true in many instances, they don’t really define what the idea behind a paragraph is. This is one of those subtle things in English writing that never really gets explained on priority making it one of those commonly used things that are barely understood. Which is why this read is going to be great.</p>
